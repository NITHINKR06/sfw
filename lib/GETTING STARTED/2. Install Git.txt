# 2. Install Git and Create a GitHub Account

Git tracks your source code history, and GitHub hosts your repositories online.

## Install Git
1. Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the installer for your OS.
2. Run the installer with the default options. On Windows, leave **"Git from the command line"** selected so Git adds itself to PATH and installs Git Bash.
3. Finish the setup wizard, then reopen your terminal so the new PATH is used.

Verify Git is available:
`ash
git --version
`
You should see something like git version 2.46.1.windows.1.

## Create or sign in to GitHub
1. Open https://github.com/signup in your browser.
2. Create an account (or sign in) and complete any verification steps.
3. Optional: enable two-factor authentication under **Settings → Password and authentication**.

## Configure Git identity
Run the following commands in your preferred terminal (replace the placeholders with your details):
`ash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
`
Check that the values were stored:
`ash
git config --list --global
`

## What’s next?
- Add SSH or HTTPS credentials later by following GitHub’s **SSH and GPG keys** guide.
- Confirm you can reach GitHub by opening https://github.com/settings/keys (after logging in).

When git --version works and your username/email are configured, proceed to Step 3.
