# 1. Install Node.js and npm

Getting Node.js installed also gives you npm (the Node Package Manager). Use the LTS build for stability.

## Download & install
1. Open https://nodejs.org/en/download and select the **LTS** installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer, accept the license, and keep the default options (this adds Node.js and npm to your PATH).
3. When the setup wizard finishes, close all existing terminals and reopen PowerShell/Command Prompt/Terminal so the new PATH is loaded.

## Verify the installation
- Show the Node.js version:
  `ash
  node -v
  `
- Show the npm version:
  `ash
  npm -v
  `
- Optional: confirm the npx helper is available:
  `ash
  npx --version
  `
  You should see semantic version numbers such as 20.10.0, 10.5.0, etc. If any command fails, reopen the installer and ensure the PATH option was enabled.

## Troubleshooting checklist
- See "Node.js command not found" → reopen a fresh terminal; Windows users may need to reboot once.
- Installer blocked? Temporarily disable antivirus, download again, or grab the zipped binary from the downloads page.
- Missing npm? Re-run the installer and pick **Repair**—npm ships with every Node.js build.

Once all three commands print versions, you’re ready for the next step.
